Level 50:(the real one!) The last 3 levels were just too easy... "This one tells you that the first 51-53 are joke. It also says it ain't gonna be easy. If you notice you will see the page has frames. If you view both sources you will notice one is the same as the first 50 but the other is different. It has conversations between people. It shows how the were known as so and so 51 and are now known as so and so 53.

Here is the conversation:

[18:12:14] <Steve_53> the new levels aren't as well thought out they just don't appear as coherent to the rest of the game.

I didn't understand it and got help from a friend. He said the game minesweeper. I didn't get it at first but then I figured it was the answer. I have no idea how he got that from the clues and he doesn't remember how either."

boring.htm
(used to be minesweeper.htm)
This difficult level was solved by KaylaWolf the new answer was submitted by pelesy.

Level 51: now you get a picture of a minesweeper game.
If you look at where the cursor is in the game you will notice you can faintly see a mine; it also seems as though he knows where all the mines are. Another clue is the title which is unfair. The player is cheating. I tried a few words like cheating, cheat, hack etc. Those words got me thinking so I checked on google for mindsweep cheats. ( http://www.consolecheatcodes.com/pc/minesweepercheats.html )
The first one is the the reveal mine. I tried reveal and then revealmine. I then noticed Spiel ? in the image and I came to the conclusion that it might be the actual code."

xyzzy.htm

This answer too was submitted by KaylaWolf, thanks

Level 52: "You will first notice a map of europe and the herbie picture behind it. You will then notice that the map is upside down. The pins point to capitals; you will get this from the title which states Case sensitive (meaning lowercase and capital...lowercase doesn't make sense here leaving capital as the clue)

I saved the pins image and googled for a map of europe(sorry didn't save the link but it is easy to find). I saved the europe map and then opened paint shop pro. I took the pins image fliped it and copied and pasted it transparently to the europe map (you may need to enlarge the pins image before copying like I did). I quickly noticed most pins did point to capitals. Only the following did:

Spain
Belgium
Luxembourg
Austria
Switzerland

I tried figuring out if they all had something in common but couldn't find anything so I then tried different combinations of the first letters as the .htm but I got nothing. I then used the anagram converter http://www.wordsmith.org/anagram/ and got slabs but that still didn't work. I looked at the source code but also got nothing. I didn't know what else to do so I asked my friend and he said I had the right Idea but that I needed the country of origin sticker letters. I googled for it and found this site http://www.europeanplates.com/originstickers.htm .

Spain = E
Belgium = B
Luxembourg = ? (I couldn't find it anywhere so I guessed L)
Austria = A
Switzerland = CH

I then used the anagram converter http://www.wordsmith.org/anagram/ and got bleach. So the link is":

bleach.htm

This is the work of KaylaWolf, thanks again!

Level 53: This one was easy. I viewed the source which had a clue. The clue was Dude what was the end of that leet song again? Leet=elite
I also translated the title m34n=mean This is leet sp34k(elite speak). If you still don't know what I mean here are two things that may help http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/children/kidtalk.mspx or http://ryanross.net/leet/ .

The clue tells you everything. The clue wants you to listen to the l33t song which means there is an mp3 you need to listen to. If you remember from other puzzles mp3's are stored in the stuff folder. So you must take this link http://deathball.net/notpron/flutsch/bleach.htm and change it to http://deathball.net/notpron/stuff/music1337.mp3 (I had first tried musicleet.mp3 but that didn't work so I tried the other way of writing elite which is l337 which worked) Listen to the Big Voodoo Daddy song Simple Songs completely. Pay attention to the last word of the song as the clue tells you to. You will notice the last word is me.

me.html

This level was submitted again by kaylawolf, thanks!

Level 54: Ok first this puzzle has two parts. The first part is very easy. Look at the source. See the clue <!--<--fucking right--> The arrow is pointing to the left but it isn't the exclamation. The exclamation mark is just part of the code which keeps the clue from displaying on the page making it only visiable in the source. Here is the entire line where the clue is at <html><!--<--fucking right--> The arrow is pointing to the html part. Look at the link http://deathball.net/notpron/flutsch/me.htmNotice anything missing at the end? The l isn't at the end of me.htm.

me.html

Level 54: Part 2 - Look at the paper the girl is holding. You will see this Pt Yb Er. For now the numbers that are small and in parenthesis by each one are not needed. Do they seem familiar? Remember chemistry? I search google for a periodic table. http://ccinfo.ims.ac.jp/periodic/periodic-main.html

Pt= Platinum
Yb= Ytterbium
Er= Erbium

For the next part you will need the numbers. I at first thought that meant the order it needed to be in ytterbiumerbiumplatinum.htm but it seemed to long. I tried it just incase but got nothing. Then I figured it meant use that many letters.

Platinum (3)= Pla
Ytterbium (1)= Y
Erbium (2)= Er

Notice anything? The letters spell out player.

player.htm

Before changing the url remember the h at the bottom of the picture. You will needed it for the next puzzle.

This level was also submitted by KaylaWolf, she's very skilled!

Level 55: I solved this one on my own no help lol. Anyways if you look in the source code it says things are only getting better. Ok now look at the pic name, it is worst. So I type in worse.jpg, i get the letter "m" then I type in bad.jpg I get "u" then I type in good.jpg I get "s" then I type in better.jpg and I get "u" then I type in best.jpg I get "m". Line the letters up from worse to best, and you spell gentle.

You get jpeg, change the pic to jpeg, overlap the 2 pics, you get 4 dots, look outside the box of the 4 dots, you get something like: soundslikeitisterrible

soundslikeitisterrible.htm

Level 57: "it has a bell and a 90 on the phone booth--that's the country code for some country--it's easy to find which one on the internet

then if you look at the source code, at the bottom it says "a 358"

the "a" stands for "area"

This is what I did. I made the url http://deathball.net/notpron/love/index.htm I hit enter and then quickly pressed stop. I then viewed the source and it states "Yeah thats the right way. Well done go to poetry.htm.
